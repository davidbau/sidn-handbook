  <h2>
    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools in natural language processing,
yet they often produce "hallucinations," which refer to outputs that are
factually incorrect, biased, or logically flawed. These hallucinations can be
broadly categorized into several types: factual inaccuracies, where the model
generates incorrect information; biases, reflecting prejudices present in the
training data; and reasoning failures, where the model's logic is flawed. The
internal mechanisms of LLMs encode signals about truthfulness, which can be used
to detect and analyze these errors. However, these signals are not universal and
vary across different tasks, indicating that LLMs have multiple ways of encoding
truth. Understanding these hallucinations involves both examining how users
perceive errors and analyzing the internal representations of LLMs. This dual
approach helps in developing strategies to mitigate errors by leveraging the
model's intrinsic knowledge.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Realted work
  </h2>


<p>
  Earlier studies primarily focused on behavioral analyses, examining how users
  perceive errors like factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures
  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02083">Bang et al., 2023</a>;
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03629">Ji et al., 2023</a>;
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05232">Ji et al., 2023</a>). These works often
  adopted human-centric frameworks, defining hallucinations based on subjective
  interpretations, which limited their ability to address the root causes of
  such errors.
  </p>

  <p>
  In contrast, recent research shifted towards examining internal
  representations of LLMs. Studies by
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05221">Kadavath et al. (2022)</a>, Li et al. (2024),
  and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Zj12nzlQbz">Chen et al. (2024)</a>
  demonstrated that LLMs encode signals of truthfulness
  within their intermediate states. However, these efforts were largely confined
  to error detection without exploring how these signals could be leveraged for
  deeper understanding or mitigation strategies.
  </p>

  <p>
  The paper builds on these insights by revealing that truthfulness information
  is concentrated in specific tokens, such as exact answer tokens, which
  significantly enhances error detection. It also challenges claims of universal
  truthfulness encoding (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06824">Marks & Tegmark, 2023</a>;
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11877">Slobodkin et al., 2023</a>),
  showing instead that LLMs encode task-specific notions of truth. Additionally,
  it identifies discrepancies between internal knowledge and external outputs,
  where models may encode correct answers but generate incorrect responses due
  to biases in training objectives.
</p>


<h2>Paper categorizes hallucinations</h2>
  <p>
The paper LLMs know more than they show categorizes hallucinations in LLMs into
several types based on their external behavior and internal representations:
  </p>
  <p>
  1. Factual Inaccuracies: Errors where the model generates incorrect factual
  information, often due to incomplete or incorrect knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
  2. Biases: Outputs that reflect prejudices or stereotypes present in the training
  data, leading to skewed or discriminatory responses.
  </p>
  <p>
  3. Reasoning Failures: Logical errors in the model's reasoning process, such as
  drawing incorrect conclusions from given premises.
  </p>
  <p>
  4. Common-Sense Failures: Errors where the model fails to apply basic
  common-sense reasoning to its responses.
  </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<img src="images/exactAnswerToken.png" style="max-width:100%; width:600;" class="mx-auto d-block">
<p>
The methodology outlined in the paper focuses
on analyzing the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to
understand and mitigate hallucinations. The researchers conducted experiments
using various LLMs, including Mistral-7b and Llama3-8b, across multiple datasets
such as TriviaQA and HotpotQA. Their approach involved training classifiers on
the internal states of LLMs, specifically targeting "exact answer tokens," which
are critical for encoding truthfulness information.
</p>
<img src="images/AUC.png" style="max-width:100%; width:600;" class="mx-auto d-block">
<p>
  The experiments were designed to evaluate error detection methods by comparing
  traditional techniques with those leveraging exact answer tokens. The
  researchers found that focusing on these specific tokens significantly
  improved error detection performance. They also explored the generalization
  of these methods across different tasks, revealing that truthfulness encoding
  is task-specific rather than universal. Additionally, the study included a
  taxonomy of error types, categorizing them based on model responses to
  repeated prompts. This analysis allowed the researchers to predict error
  patterns and develop tailored mitigation strategies
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<img src="images/results.png" style="max-width:100%; width:600;" class="mx-auto d-block">
<p>
A key finding is that truthfulness signals are highly localized in specific
tokens, particularly the "exact answer tokens." Probing these tokens
significantly improved error detection performance across various tasks and
datasets. For instance, using exact answer tokens enhanced the area under the
ROC curve (AUC) for error detection methods compared to traditional approaches
like logits-based uncertainty estimations.
</p>

<p>
The study also revealed that these improvements are task-specific. Probing
classifiers trained on one dataset often failed to generalize effectively to
others unless the tasks required similar skills, such as factual retrieval or
common-sense reasoning. This finding challenges prior claims of a universal
truthfulness encoding in LLMs, suggesting instead that LLMs encode multiple,
distinct notions of truthfulness depending on the task.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, the study explored error types by analyzing repeated model
  outputs. It categorized errors into patterns such as "consistently incorrect,"
  "two competing answers," and "many answers." The internal states of LLMs
  were found to encode information about these error types, enabling their
  prediction with reasonable accuracy.
</p>


<p>
  Finally, a significant discrepancy was identified between LLMs' internal
  truthfulness encoding and their external outputs. In some cases, models
  internally encoded correct answers but consistently generated incorrect ones
  due to biases in training objectives favoring plausible over accurate
  responses. This highlights opportunities for leveraging internal signals
  to align outputs with encoded knowledge, improving performance and
  reliability.
</p>

<h2>Our extended experiment</h2>
<p>
  We adopted the code from the paper and experimented with medical dataset. We
  entended the code to work with LLAMA 3.2 1B. We first performed LoRA fine
  tuning on the model to encode medical information into the models. We then
  continued the same experimentation.
</p>

<p>
  MedQuAD: A dataset with 47,457 Q&A pairs from 12 National Institutes of
  Health (NIH) websites, spanning 37 question types (e.g., treatments,
  diagnoses, side effects) and enriched with annotations like medical IDs and
  categories.

<h2>Opinion and Takeaway</h2>
<p>
Hallucinations: Do the internal representations of LLMs encode much more
information about truthfulness : (ex: error types) ? <b>Yes</b>
</p>

<p>
Where are the truthfulness signals encoded in LLMs ? <b>Exact answer tokens</b>
</p>

<p>
Are these internal representations generalizable across different tasks? <b>Not
  all the time</b>
</p>

<p>
Does the modelâ€™s internal encoding identify the correct answerâ€“yet might
  frequently generate an incorrect response? <b>Yes</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Opinion:</b> Train the LLMs tailored towards the errors â€“ more than bigger
models and data.
