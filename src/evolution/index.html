                    With Large Language Models (LLMs), we have been seeing the trend where larger models show emergent and better capabilities. In this project, we ask the question: "What are the added layers being used for by an LLM?". We first establish a model of mechanistic information flow in the models, we call "stages", and investigates the internal mechanisms of LLMs and how they change as model size increases.
                    Specifically, we will look at the following questions:

                    <li>What are the early layers in LLMs doing?</li>
                    <li>Where are the facts localized in models?</li>
                    <li>At what layers does the model transfer the knowledge of fact?</li>
                    <li>When does the model have enough information to know the answer?</li>
                    <li>Where is "processing" really happening in the models?</li>

                    This project builds upon a rich body of research dedicated to understanding the inner workings of LLMs.
                    Seminal works have explored attention mechanisms and their role in passing extracted information <span class="citation">[1]</span>, the emergence of factual knowledge
                    representation <span class="citation">[2]</span>, and the development of techniques to probe and analyze these models <span class="citation">[3]</span>. Our work contributes to this ongoing discourse by providing a comparative analysis of different LLM sizes and
                    applying these methods to unravel the complexities of their internal representations and processing.

                                            Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) is a multivariate technique that compares diverse data types by examining shared patterns in their similarity matrices. Originally proposed by 
                                            <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full?utm_source=FWEB&utm_medium=NBLOG&utm_campaign=ECO_10YA_top-research" target="_blank">Kriegeskorte et al. [7]</a> 
                                            to link brain activity patterns to computational models and behavior, RSA works by subjecting the brain/model to different stimuli and extracting activity patterns. Pairwise correlations are computed to create a dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which captures the representational geometry of the data. This enables comparison across different data types and models.

                            As models get larger, they seem to perform better on various tasks <span class="citation">[4, 5]</span>. It is interesting to see that the metrics show only 2 points increase from 70B to 405B. But this does not reflect the emergent capabilties in the 405B (huh .. i wonder what it says about the evaluations we do)

                            Once the model extracts the facts or knowledge about the input prompt, it has to, at some point, transfer this information to the location where the model needs this information to make a decision of the next token. For this, we conduct an attention knockout experiment <span class="citation">[1]</span>, where we block attention from subject tokens to the final tokens at every layer and plot the change in the output distribution. We find that all the model sizes almost drop the accuracies at 40% through 70% of the layer depths. This suggests that these middle layers transfer information.

                            Okay, the model knows about the fact, transfers it to the token for prediction. Its a good time to ask a generic question - "how does the model process all this information at each layer?". For this, we conduct an intrisic dimensionality experiment and find that at the same 40% layer depth for all models, they start using high dimensions to process information.

                        But this doesnot align with what we have seen so far! So we look at the causal importance of these layers. Are these layers really being used by the model? We found -  NO! There is a good gap of 7-9 layers between when the model has enough information to when it actually uses it.

                                The RSA analysis reveals distinct processing stages across model sizes, with early layers showing high similarity, middle layers displaying diverse patterns, and later layers converging again. Cross-model comparisons demonstrate that different sized models develop analogous representations at similar relative depths, with stronger similarity between larger models.
