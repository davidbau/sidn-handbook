<h3>scoring rubric</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>+1: introduction poses the question, links the papers
    <li>+1: authors are identified and described
    <li>+1: background context is described, key previous works cited
    <li>+1: diagrams show the main methods or results visually
    <li>+1: contrast is drawn, identifying differences between the papers
    <li>+1: Code examples are included, demonstrating the methods
    <li>+1: Discussion with your own opinions, questions, or perspective
  </ul>
</p>

<p><em>Introduction</em> that poses the question, links the papers, describes authors and background context
introduction rubric:
<ul>
  <li>+1: crisply describes the problem being solved. Cites and links the main papers.
  <li>+1: authors - identifies the authors, says a few words about who they are, where they worked, what they are known for.
  <li>+1: background - give context. how the problem was preivously tackled, why the problem emerged as an interesting topic in the history. Use the paper's own literature review to identify related older papers. Then cite a few of the key older papers.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>A Need for Formulation</h2>
<p>rubric details:
  <ul>
    <li>+1: diagram - describe methods in the paper visually
    <li>+1: contrast - don't just say what each paper does, but focuses on the differences between them.
    <li>+1: Code - help your readers by giving them concrete code samples to run. Colab notebooks with all the installation steps.
    <li>+1: discussion - go beyond the facts and share your own perspective.
  </ul>
