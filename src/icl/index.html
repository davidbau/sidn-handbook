  <p>"In-context learning" (ICL) identifies to a phenomenon in which a language model shows decreasing loss as one or more task examples are added to its context window. The modern era of ICL begins with Brown et al., (2020) who extend the multi-task learning https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/a:1007379606734, scaling law (Kaplan, Hestness), and  meta-learning https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/finn17a.html literatures with a massively scaled version of GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). Although GPT-2 showed early signs of ICL, the new model, GPT-3, displays state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of NLP benchmarks, without relying on any finetuning.</p>

  <p>The ICL literature has expanded rapidly since the publication of Brown, et. al, (2020), with investigations into TODO, TODO, TODO, . (For a full survey, see Dong et al., (2024).) Of particular relevance to us is the induction heads phenomenon (LINK), which we've covered in previous weeks (LINK).</p>

  <p>This week, we'll discuss two papers which attempt to characterize <i>how</i> ICL works in large language models.</p>
