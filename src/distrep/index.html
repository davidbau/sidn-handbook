<h5>September 17, 2024 â€¢ <em>David Bau</em></h5>

<p>Today we begin a segment of the class dealing with
<em>understanding representations</em>: understanding
the ways that information might be encoded in the
patterns of neural activations in a neural network.

<p>In the previous chapter on <a href="/neurons/">neurons</a>,
we examined several efforts to visualize and understand the
"concepts" that might be represented by individual neurons in
an artificial neural network.  The idea that individual neurons
might directly correspond to interpretable variables is the
"Local Representation" hypothesis.  As we saw, some individual
neurons do seem encode specific concepts. However, in practice,
many other individual neurons seem to lack clear mappings
to discrete understandable concepts. 

<p>In the general case, all we can say is that all the neurons
in work together to store the aggregate information in a network.
Hinton, McClelland, and Rumelhart have advocated the
hypothesis that this collective cooperation between many neurons is
irreducible, and that every neuron is involved in encoding
many different concepts; this is their
<a href="https://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Chapter3.pdf">Distributed Representation</a>
model, and they have advocated this viewpoint since their 1987 work
"Parallel Distributed Processing" (PDP).

<p>If information is inherently distributed, then instead of
examining individual neurons \( h_i \in \mathbb{R} \) as scalar variables, we
should examine the <em>vector space</em> \( \mathbf{h} \in \mathbb{R}^N \)
of all the neurons together; we call this collective vector space the
<em>representation space</em> of the network.  In a feedforward
neural network, each layer of neurons is a bottleneck that fully
determines all the subsequent information in a network, so we will
typically look at the representation vector for the neurons in
a single layer \( \mathbf{h} \ in \mathbb{R}^d \), where the dimensionality
\( d \) is given by the number of neurons in a layer.

<p>In 1987, the PDP authors examined several
possible ways of encoding information in a distributed fashion
within a representation vector space, from hash coding, to hierarchical
schemes, compositional approaches, and sequential processing ideas.
But what kind of encoding scheme do our neural networks use in practice?
For example, in their Figure 2, they observed the following dilemma.
Suppose neurons collaborate in two groups to encode an \( (x, y) \)
combination, like a point on a plane.  It leads to the problem that
if you use the same scheme to encode two points, there is not an
ambiguity for which \( x \) goes with which \( y \).  Thus they
faced a puzzle: when sets of neurons distribute information, how do they
encode it effectively?

<p>We begin today by looking at two recent papers that tackle this
representation encoding question from a geometric point of view, beginning
with mathematical principles and looking for some empirical support.

<h2>Toy Models of Superposition</h2>

<p>The paper <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy
Models of Superposition</a> is a blog post by Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah's group at Anthropic
in collaboration with Martin Wattenberg at Harvard. [Why a blog?  For years, Olah has been
a big advocate of publishing research in non-traditionally-peer-reviewed blog formats.]

<h3>The Goal: Enumeration</h3>

<p>To understand the motivation of the paper, it is helpful to start at the end; in
their section 9, they explain that they would like to understand how to <b>enumerate</b>
all the features in a representation.

<blockquote>
We'd like a way to have confidence that models will never do certain behaviors such
as "deliberately deceive" or "manipulate." Today, it's unclear how one might show this,
but we believe a promising tool would be the ability to
<em>identify and enumerate over all features</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>Recall that this team had previously developed catalogs of neurons when
they previously worked at OpenAI.  And they note that if each interpertable
variable corresponded to one neuron, then "you could enumerate over features
by enumerating over neurons."  Yet if we are in a distributed representation
where every neuron is involved in encoding multple variables, then it is unclear
how to find the representations of all the variables, or even how to identify
what the variables are.

<h3>The Data: Synthetic Sparse Features</h3>

<p>To begin to tackle this reverse-engineering problem, the paper takes
the approach of training very small neural networks on very small problems
for which they can define a ground truth for the "interpretable variables."
Then they will ask: how does the network represent information about these variables?

<p>To play the role of interpretable variables, they propose "sparse features."
Sparse features are an idea that date back to Hinton in 1987, (they also cite neuroscientists
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698997001697">Olshausen 1997</a>).
A sparse feature is a variable that is usually zero, but that becomes
positive in the rare but interesting situations where there is something to say.
For example, a sparse feature might be "there is a dog's head in the photo."
Since most photos don't include dog heads, it's usually zero, but sometimes it
is positive, and it could be a large number if there are lot of dogs (for example).

<p>In their various experiments, Elhage does not use "real" data for features but
rather synthesizes random sparse features, which give them control over the
following two characteristics for each feature \( x_i \):

\[ S_i \text{ is the sparsity of the $i$th feature, that is the probabilitity it is zero.} \]
\[ I_i \text{ is the importance of the $i$th feature, cost incurred if information about it was lost.} \]

<p>For each experiment, they preselect an $S_i$ and $I_i$ for each of $n$ features, and then
they synthesize fake data by creating random vectors \( [ x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \] \) that follow
the sparsity probabilities.  They use this data to train neural networks
on various tasks, then analyze the representations that are learned.  Since they know
the mathematical characteristics of their invented sparse features, they can measure
how those characteristics relate to different types of representations.
