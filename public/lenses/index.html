<h5>September 26, 2024 â€¢ <em>Prajnan Goswami, Ritik Bompilwar</em></h5>

<p>
  The launch of GPT-3 by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">Brown et al. (2020)</a> marked 
  a turning point, drawing widespread attention to the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) 
  and their applications such as ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. In parallel, diffusion models emerged as a 
  powerful tool for synthesizing high-fidelity images as demonstrated by 
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Ho et al.(2020)</a> and 
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752"> Rombach et al. (2021)</a>. 
  These new generative AI approaches led to a paradigm shift in scaling up models 
  and data to extract more performance. 

<h3>Scaling Trends in the Evolution of Generative Models (In a Nutshell) </h3>  
<p>
  A study by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361"> Kaplan et al.</a> highlights the significance of 
  model size, dataset scale, and compute used in training. Their analysis indicates that larger models 
  will continue to perform better. Regardless of their findings, we can clearly observe 
  how these models have scaled up over time: 

  <ul>
    <li>
    2019, <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models
    /language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT-2</a>, <b>1.5</b> billion parameters
    </li>
    <li>
    2020, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, <b>175</b> billion parameters
    </li>
    <li>
    2024, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1</a>, <b>405</b> billion parameters.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>  

<h2>Looking Through the Lens of Interpretability</h3>

<p> Although scaling up these approaches has led to significant capabilities 
  and performance improvements, understanding the hidden representations 
  and interpret how the model progresses toward generating its final output 
  through all the intermediate layers.

<p>
  For example, when applying linear probing from the 
  <a href="/probing/">previous chapter</a> to a Large Language Model(LLM), 
  the process would involve training a separate probe for each layer. 
  Additionally, each probe would require a predefined set of labels 
  (e.g., sentiment, part-of-speech tags etc.) to evaluate specific 
  types of information the model might encode. 

<p>
  In other words, probing LLMs is challenging because it requires 
  interpreting large, multi-dimensional representations, and the 
  results may not reflect the model's internal working for its original tasks.
  To address these challenges, we need a mechanism to directly look at (ðŸ‘€ ðŸ”Ž) the hidden
  representations of a large scale generative AI model without any external probes.


<p>
  This chapter will focus on some of these technqiues which offer a clearer view of 
  how these large-scale model processes and represents information at each layer.


<h3>Visualizing GPT through a Lens ðŸ”Ž</h3>

<p>
  The first attempt on how to interpret the internal workings of a 
  GPT-like model was introduced in an anonymous blog post 
  <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens">Interpreting GPT: the logit lens â€” LessWrong.</a> 
  The idea was fairly straightforward. In GPT-2/GPT-3, predictions are formed in a series 
  of steps across multiple Transformer layers. The Logit Lens "peeks ðŸ‘€" at these 
  intermediate stages by taking the intermediate outputs at each layer and projecting 
  them directly into the vocabulary space. In other words, the intermediate output from 
  different layers is passed through the same output head that the final layer uses to 
  predict the next token as shown in the figure below. 

  <img src="images/logit_vs_tuned_lens_fig1.png" style="max-width:80%; width:800px;" class="mx-auto d-block">

  <p>
    What makes this approach special is that, rather then relying on external probs, Logit lens uses 
    its own prediction head to interpret the hidden representations. By doing so, we can easily track 
    the evolution of the model's understanding at every processing stage. That being said, this first
    attemt had few limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Belrose et al. highlighted three specific limitations of Logit Lens in their paper 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08112">Eliciting Latent Predictions from 
    Transformers with the Tuned Lens</a>.  

    <ul>
      <li>
        This same method didnâ€™t work well for other models such as 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100">BLOOM (Scao et al.)</a> and
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068">OPT 125M (Zhang et al.)</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is biased towards some vocabulary until the final layer of GPT. 
        In simple terms, this means that the output of the intervention layer
        is skewed towards certain words when compared to the final output of the 
        GPT model itself.
        
        <p>
        <img src="images/logit_lens_bias.png" style="max-width:80%; width:600px;" class="mx-auto d-block">

        <p>
        The x-axis represents the different layers of the neural network, and 
        the y-axis represents the difference (in bits) between the output of 
        the method and the final output of the model.
      </li>
      <li>
        And finally Logit Lens is prone to representational drift. What it really
        means is that the hidden representations at the intervention layer does not align 
        with the input representation of the final layer. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
